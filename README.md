# ‚ôüÔ∏è AI Tic-Tac-Toe App (Unbeatable Minimax)

## üí° Project Origin

This project's initial structure, core component setup (using `shadcn-ui`), and configuration for the Vite/React/TypeScript stack were rapidly generated with the help of **Lovable AI**.

The result is a highly maintainable and modern foundation, allowing me to focus immediately on the core logic and features.

## ‚ú® Technologies Used

This application is built using the following modern stack:

-   **Vite**: A fast, modern build tool for front-end development.
-   **TypeScript**: Provides strong typing for scalable and robust code.
-   **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
-   **shadcn-ui** / **Radix UI**: A collection of high-quality, accessible UI components.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first framework for rapid styling and customization.
